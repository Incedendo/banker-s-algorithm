My lab is written in Pascal.

The MAKEFILE  is included in the zip. You just need to type make to compile and type the command "./banker filename.txt" to run it

I spent around 10 hours plus on this lab. The installation was easy because Debian has a very quick way of installing pascal straight from the command prompt

Half the time was spent reading in the I/O, relearning pascal syntax for array, 2d array, function and subroutine.

The program run as specified: ./banker filename.txt

It has basic error checking to make sure the file name is entered.
